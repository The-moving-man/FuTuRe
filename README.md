# Stellar Remittance Platform

A cross-border remittance application built on the Stellar blockchain, enabling fast and low-cost international money transfers.

This repository includes both frontend and backend services for building a Stellar payment experience.

## Features

- Create Stellar accounts
- Check account balances
- Send XLM payments
- Low transaction fees (~$0.00001)
- Fast settlement (3-5 seconds)

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js + Express + Stellar SDK
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Blockchain: Stellar (Testnet)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure backend environment:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

See `backend/CONFIGURATION.md` for environment options, validation rules, and optional encrypted secrets.

3. Configure frontend environment (optional):

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `VITE_API_URL` to your production API endpoint when deploying to a CDN or different domain. Leave empty for development (Vite proxy handles `/api` requests to `localhost:3001`).

4. Start development servers:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on http://localhost:3001
Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000

## Docker (recommended for local development)

Docker Compose spins up the full stack — PostgreSQL, Redis, backend, and frontend — with a single command. No local database installation required.

### Start

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432` (user `future_admin`, db `future_remittance`, password `dev_password`)
- Redis: `localhost:6379`

Prisma migrations run automatically on backend startup. Source directories are bind-mounted so the backend (`node --watch`) and frontend (Vite HMR) both hot-reload on file changes.

### Stop

```bash
docker compose down          # stop containers, keep the db volume
docker compose down -v       # stop and delete the db volume
```

### Local overrides

To customise ports, credentials, or log levels without editing the shared file:

```bash
cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
# edit docker-compose.override.yml — it is git-ignored
docker compose up --build
```

### Service communication

| From                  | To       | Address                 |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| backend               | postgres | `postgres:5432`         |
| backend               | redis    | `redis:6379`            |
| frontend (Vite proxy) | backend  | `http://backend:3001`   |
| browser               | frontend | `http://localhost:3000` |
| browser               | backend  | `http://localhost:3001` |

## Usage

1. Click "Create Account" to generate a new Stellar keypair
2. Account is automatically funded on testnet via Friendbot
3. Check balance to see your XLM
4. Send payments to other Stellar addresses

## Testnet Setup

### Friendbot

Friendbot is Stellar's automated account-funding service for the testnet. It credits any new (or unfunded) Stellar public key with **10,000 test XLM** at no cost, letting you start testing payments immediately without real funds.

Fund an account via the API directly:

```bash
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
```

Or use the bundled helper script (see `scripts/fund-testnet-account.sh`):

```bash
bash scripts/fund-testnet-account.sh GCEZWKCA5VLDNRLN3RPRJMRZOX3Z6G5CHCGZWM9CQJHD9QDNHXHXN
```

The app calls Friendbot automatically when you click **Create Account** in the UI.

### Testnet Limitations

- **Quarterly resets** — the Stellar testnet is wiped roughly every three months. All accounts, balances, and transaction history are deleted. You must re-fund accounts after each reset.
- Test XLM has no monetary value and cannot be transferred to mainnet.
- Friendbot is only available on testnet; it does not exist on mainnet.

### Testnet vs. Mainnet Configuration

| Setting             | Testnet                               | Mainnet                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `STELLAR_NETWORK`   | `testnet`                             | `mainnet`                                        |
| `HORIZON_URL`       | `https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org` | `https://horizon.stellar.org`                    |
| Network passphrase  | `Test SDF Network ; September 2015`   | `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015` |
| Friendbot available | ✅ Yes                                | ❌ No                                            |
| Real funds          | ❌ No                                 | ✅ Yes                                           |

Set `STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet` (the default) in `backend/.env` for local development. Change to `mainnet` only for production deployments.

Hitting a Horizon error while testing payments (`tx_bad_seq`, `op_underfunded`, `op_no_trust`, etc.)? See [docs/guides/stellar-errors.md](docs/guides/stellar-errors.md) for what each one means and how to fix it.

## Next Steps

- Add stablecoin support (USDC)
- Integrate fiat on/off ramps
- Add exchange rate conversion
- Implement KYC/AML compliance
- Add transaction history
- Mobile app development
